    "# How to use *map2loop* with your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deconstruct a map with *map2loop*, we need to undertake the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Ensure that we have sufficient correctly formatted data, with sufficient information to allow the calculations to work.\n",
    "2.  Once we have these data, we then need to define a set of parameters that inform *map2loop* about this data, and the details of the calculations to undertaken. Use the notebook [Utility 1 - Config file generator.ipynb](Utility%201%20-%20Config%20file%20generator.ipynb) to make this slightly less painful.\n",
    "3.  Finally, once we have the data and *map2loop* control parameters sorted, we are ready to create a small python script to test the system.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Stratigraphic Coherency:\n",
    "    -   Ideally the map should consist of polygons which all have the same stratigraphic heirarchical level, e.g. all formations, all groups, all members etc. This is often not the case, and it makes unravelling the stratigraphy more complex, as the parent and child may appear in the same map, so the age sorting needed to build the model becomes ambiguous. National or state-level stratigraphies, and even stratigraphies described on map sheet legends are by definition simplifications of the the local system extracted by *map2loop*. *map2loop* uses the local stratigraphy first and then uses the regional stratigraphy (if available) as a guide to reduce the uncertainty.\n",
